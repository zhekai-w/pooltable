LET'S SAY N CUEBALLS (INDEXING IS VERY IMPORTANT)

create 2(one for x one for y) N-1 by 6 2d array to store clean_vectors_BH
loop from i 0~N-1	
	draw vectors from ball i to each aiming point. save 6 vetors_BH. 
	draw vectors from ball i to the rest of cueballs. save N-1 vectors_BB.

	loop from j 0~5
		dotproducts of vectors_BH j and vectors_BB 0~N-1.
		if dotproduct > 0
			if vectors_BH i have no cueballs between. (can be sum into one fuction)
				save vectors_BH j in clean_vectors_BH in i row (meaning cueball i has clean vector_BH j)
			else count how many balls is between cueballs and hole
